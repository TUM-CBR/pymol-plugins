# CBR Bioinformatics Tools

This repository contains Bioinformatics tools developed by the [Lehrstuhl f√ºr Chemie Biogener Rohstoffe](https://cbr.cs.tum.de/). They are packaged as a [PyMol](https://pymol.org/2/) plugin
for them to be easy to use and install. Additionally, they can leverage from the features already in PyMol to allow beter user interaction with the results.

For more information and the user's manual, please refer to [The CBR Bioinformatics Tools Wiki](https://github.com/TUM-CBR/pymol-plugins/wiki).
